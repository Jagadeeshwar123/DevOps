DevOps :- DevOps is a process of improving the application delivery by ensuring that there is a proper automation and quality and continuous monitoring and there is a continuous testing

***AWS***

What is cloud :- Global network of server each with a unique function
public cloud :- AWS, Azure, GCP
Private Cloud :- VMware, HPE, IBM  etc:-

IAM gives the authorization and authentication  . IAM can be used by anyone useful for read only access
 whereas root user can change in the aws account
 
users  
groups
policies
roles

EC2 instance :- Elastic cloud compute
compute:- combination of cpu,ram and disk  (virtual server)
elastic:- increase or decrease the resourse . elastic in nature
Types of EC2 instances
1)General purpose
2)compute optimised
3)memory optimised
4)storage optimised
5)accelerated compute

virtualization:- a physical server brought from HP or IBM will install a hypervisor to not to waste the server with only one user 

Hypervisor:- It is a software that can install virtual machines on physical server using logical isolation 
some of the popular hypervisers is VMWARE , XEN

Script for automation :- aws cli , aws api, aws cft , aws cdk ,TERRAFORM directly communicating with api


Linux:- OS
It is an open source s/w 
it is very secure
It is very fast
It has many distributions EX:- CENTOS,FEDERO,UBUNTU, DEBIAN etc:-
Architecture of a linux OS (KERNEL):-

Kernel is the heart of linux , it is useful for establishing the communication b/w s/w and h/w
Kernel has 4 primary responsibilities
1)Device management
2)Memory management
3)Process management 
4)handling system calls	

System Libraries:-
Is is responsible for performing a task . 

Shell commands:-

Using the command line we are communicating with the operating system with shell commands
Shell commands is mostly useful for the linux operating system
These commands are  same for all the distributions

Commands :-

ls - list (what all are available in a directory
ls/etc/  :- it is useful for getting all the files in the system
ls -a    :- it is used to show all files and directories including hidden ones within the specified directory
cd - change directory
cd .. - back to the previous directory
cd../.. - back to previous previous directory
mkdir - make directory
rm  - remove the file
rm -r   - remove a directory
touch - it is used only to create a file
vim :-  it is used to create and write something in a file at a time
pwd - present working directory
ls -ltr   - details of the files and directories in a particular directory
vi   - create a file and write something inside the file
after vi command hit escape and hit i to enable the field to enter the text , then again hit escape and enter :wq! to save the file
cat   - to see what the text we have entered in a file without opening a file
FOR SYSTEM PROPERTIES:-
free -g  :- memory
nproc :- number of cpu's used
df -h :- disc size
top  :- to see all the system properties in one place
to exit from the top command press q
man :- prefix as "man" used to know the funcionality of a command 
(#!/) - shebang
bash / dash/sh/ksh :- these are executables . these executables should be used as shebang/bin/any of the executable
echo in linux should be used as same as print in java
chmod :- it is used to grant the permissions . Ch - change , 
chmod gives permissions to 3 things . they are 
1)what is the permissions for you
2)what is the permissions for your group
3)what is the permissions for all users
chmod uses 4, 2, 1 manner which says
4 as read
2 as write
1 as execute
and the chmod should be used along with numerics with the help of 4,2,1
ex:-chmod 777 . it states that the permissions are granted to read,write and executre for you,your group and everyone
    chmod 600 . it states that the permissions are granted to read and write only for you and no permissions for your group and everyone
you                  
your group
everyone
./filename - it is used to execute the shell script
ctrl + c :- to stop the execution

purpose of shell scripting in DevOps

devops is responsible for 
1)infrastructure management
2)git code management
3)configuration management
for all these Linux will be useful
 
ps -ef   :-ps stands for processess and f stands for format . this command is used to know what all the processess in the linux system
          like stopped, running, deamon, background etc :-
grep  :- it is used to get the information of a particular process it is used as :- ps -ef | grep "process that we need to know"
         grp name filename  :- it will gives the name word highlighted
grep -o  :- it says that "only" . if we want to print any particular letter or number we use "(grep -o "ltr/no" <<<"$x" | wc -l)" command

pipe  :- grep will be used along with pipe (|) . it will sends the output from first command to the second command
date  :- it will give the today's date and information
 date is a system default command it will send the information to stdin but pipe will not read from stdin . 
  so, date | echo "today's date"
  it will print today's date word itself but not the date information
awk  :- it is used to get the details of a particular column among all
it is used in a format as ex:- (ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F" " 'print $2')  , (grep name | awk -F" " '{print $4}')
set -x  :- it is useful for debugging the script which will gives us what the command we used along with the output
set -e  :- it is  used to throw an error at a particular point where the script is not correct . but it doesn't useful for the pipe
           commands. it only takes the last function in a pipe argument
set -o pipefail   :- it is used along with the set -e . it is useful for throwing an error at the point where script is not correct even
                     for the pipe commands
** we can use all at once by appending :- set -exo pipefail

logfile  :- it is useful for finding the errors in log file
curl  :- it is useful for retrieving the information from internet. as well as for the api requests and responses like postman  
         it is used as curl logfile url
         if want to know the particulars then use grep . EX:- for getting the error logs as ("curl logfile url | grep error")
wget  :- it is as same as curl but here with wget it will download the logfile and by using cat command we can see the logfile info
         if we want particulars then cat downloaded logfile name | grep error . whereas the curl will download and display the logfile
         info
sudo  :- sudo is used to navigate to the root user , it is used as "sudo su -" . Whenever we are in root user no need of using sudo
         if we are in ubuntu user use "sudo" for performing actions on behalf of root user
su    :- su stands for switch user by using this we can switch b/w the users . we can use this command as "su username"
find  :- find is used to find the particular file inside a system it is used as 
         1)if we are in root user "find / -name pam.d"
         2)if we are in ubuntu user "sudo find / -name pam.d"
if else loop  :-  it is used to write for the conditions . it can be used as
               ex  :- a=2 , b=3 if [ $a < $b ] then echo "stmnt" else "stmnt" fi
for loop      :- if we want to execute the script for multiple iterations . it can be used as
              ex  :- for i in {1..100}; do echo $1; done
                    for i in {1..100}
                    do
                        echo $i
                    done	
trap    :- it is useful for trapping the signals in linux
kill    :- it is used to kill a process . it can be used as "kill -9 process name/process id"  

traceroute is a tool used for the network debugging.
traceroute google.com . it is useful for knowing the information of the hops 

sort   :- sort is used for sorting something . linux has pre installed sort command

CRONJOB   :-  it is useful for scheduling the time for doing something through the shell script

aws s3 ls   :- it will print the s3 resources
aws ec2 describe-instances   :-  it will print the ec2 resources
aws lambda list-functions  :- it will print the lambda resources
aws iam list-users         :- it will print the iam resources

| more   :- it is used to read the output in a file mode
jq       :- it is used to read the json

aws ec2 describe-instances | jq '.;;;;;;[].;;;;;;[].;;;;;;'

***********************AWS*************************

Aws is a cloud provider and it follows a infrastructure as a service(IAAS) and platform as a service(PAAS)
DevOps is always about automation and eficiency
AWS services for DevOps
1)ec2 services
2)VPC(virtual private cloud
3)EBS(volume or storage related services)
4)s3(Storage)	
5)IAM (Identity and access management)
6)cloud watch :- takes care of monitoring in aws . It is constantly monitoring what are the actions performing in aws  
7)Lamda   :- it is a serverless compute which are used for short actions
8)cloud build services   :- aws provides some build services are  
                            1)aws code pipeline
                            2)aws code build

11)AWS KMS(Key Management Service)  :- to keep the important files secure
12)Cloud Trail  :- it is used to enable operational and risk audit . it records api activities
13)aws eks(Elastic Kubernetes Service) :-

*************************************configuration management (ANSIBLE)******************************************

Configuration Management :-it is useful for managing the configuration of multiple servers

***Ansible is used to work on the different servers at one go from a single server ***

examples for configuration management are puppet , chef , salt , ansible etc:-
most nummber of devops engineers prefer to use ansible
Ansible Playbooks :- ansible files are called as playbooks . it is used to perform multiple tasks
ansible adhoc commands :- it is used to perform one or two tasks
inventory file  :- the file which stores all the ip addressess of the target servers

setting up the passwordless authentication   :- Copied the public ip address of the main server to the authorized key of the target server

ansible -i inventory ipaddress   :- it will get the particular server from the inventory file
ansible -i all    :- it will get all the servers from the inventory file  

ansible adhoc command ex:-   ansible -i inventory all -m "module(shell)" -a "action performing (touch)"
ansible playbook command  :- ansible-playbook -i inventory name of the playbook

group the ip's in inventory file as [group name] and execute the script using adhoc commands by using group name

ansible playbooks is in yml format

"---" indicates the particular file is yml file 
if we are performing multiple tasks then use "-" before each task to list the group of tasks

#################################################################################
******** sample ansible playbook in yml format *********

- name: install and start nginx
  hosts: all
  become: root

tasks:
  - name: install nginx
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
  - name: start nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: started
#################################################################################


ansible roles:- it is the efficient way of writing ansible playbooks that will improve efficiency of complex playbooks
ansible-galaxy role init kubernetes :- it is used to create roles



***************************************************CI/CD(Jenkins)*******************************************************
CI(Continuous Integration) :- It is a process to integrate set of tools/processess that follows before delivering the application
CD(Continuous Delivery)    :- It is a process of deploy application on a specific platform

Jenkins  :- Jenkins is an archestrator which will integrate all the processess that needs to be done using pipeline

groovy script used in the pipeline 

ex:-  pipeline{
tools{
tool 1
}
stages{
stage("1"){
steps{
step 1
step 2
}
post{
success{
}
}


*******************************************Infrastructure as code (TERRAFORM)*******************************************
Terraform :- It is an infrastructure as code (IAC) . A tool that allows you to build, change and version infrastructure safely and
             efficiently
terraform will convert to  configuration file to provider that api will understand 
it is used for 
1)managing the infrastructure
2)track the infrastructure
3)automate changes
4)standardize the configurations
5)collaborate

the language used is hashicorp lang

terraform runs on 4 commands 
1) Terrform init  - initialize
2)terraform plan  - dry run it gives us what exactly will be performing before execute the script
3)terraform apply  - execute
4)terraform destroy- destroy
